        JavaScript , often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, just-in-time compiled, 
        multi-paradigm programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript 
        has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.

        Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. 
        JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. 
        The vast majority of websites use it,[12] and major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript 
        engine to execute it.
       </p>
       <p>
        Initially only implemented client-side in web browsers, JavaScript engines are now embedded 
        in many other types of host software, including server-side in web servers and databases, and 
        in non-web programs such as word processors and PDF software, and in runtime environments that 
        make JavaScript available for writing mobile and desktop applications, including desktop widgets.

        The terms Vanilla JavaScript and Vanilla JS refer to JavaScript not extended by any frameworks 
        or additional libraries. Scripts written in Vanilla JS are plain JavaScript code.
        
        Although there are similarities between JavaScript and Java, including language name, syntax, and 
        respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design. JavaScript 
        was influenced by programming languages such as Self and Scheme.[15] The JSON serialization format, 
        used to store data structures in files or transmit them across networks, is based on JavaScript.
       </p>
       <p>An example of Javascript code is:</p>
       <code>
         console.log('Hello World!');
       </code>

        In 1993, the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), a unit of the University of
         Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, released NCSA Mosaic, the first popular graphical Web browser, 
         which played an important part in expanding the growth of the nascent World Wide Web beyond the 
         NeXTSTEP niche where the WorldWideWeb had formed three years earlier. In 1994, a company called 
         Mosaic Communications was founded in Mountain View, California and employed many of the original 
         NCSA Mosaic authors to create Mosaic Netscape. However, it intentionally shared no code with NCSA Mosaic.

        There is a common misconception that JavaScript was influenced by an earlier Web page scripting language 
        developed by Nombas named Cmm (not to be confused with the later C-- created in 1997).[22][23] 
        Brendan Eich, however, had never heard of Cmm before he created LiveScript. Nombas did pitch 
        their embedded Web page scripting to Netscape, though Web page scripting was not a new concept, 
        as shown by the ViolaWWW Web browser.[24] Nombas later switched to offering JavaScript instead of
         Cmm in their ScriptEase product and was part of the TC39 group that standardized ECMAScript.

      <header>Functions</header>
      <p>
        A function is first-class; a function is considered to be an object. As such, a function may have properties
         and methods, such as .call() and .bind().[48] A nested function is a function defined within another 
         function. It is created each time the outer function is invoked. In addition, each nested function forms 
         a lexical closure: The lexical scope of the outer function (including any constant, local variable, or 
         argument value) becomes part of the internal state of each inner function object, even after execution 
         of the outer function concludes.[49] JavaScript also supports anonymous functions.
      </p>
      <p>
        
        JavaScript natively supports various function-based implementations of Role patterns like 
        Traits[51][52] and Mixins.[53] Such a function defines additional behavior by at least one 
        method bound to the this keyword within its function body. A Role then has to be delegated 
        explicitly via call or apply to objects that need to feature additional behavior that is not 
        shared via the prototype chain.

      <header>Arrays</header>
      <p>
        Arrays are list-like objects whose prototype has methods to perform traversal and mutation 
        operations. Neither the length of a JavaScript array nor the types of its elements are fixed.
         Since an array's length can change at any time, and data can be stored at non-contiguous 
         locations in the array, JavaScript arrays are not guaranteed to be dense; this depends on 
         how the programmer chooses to use them. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Arrays cannot use strings as element indexes (as in an associative array) but must use 
        integers. Setting or accessing via non-integers using bracket notation (or dot notation) 
        will not set or retrieve an element from the array list itself, but will set or access a 
        variable associated with that array's object property collection.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>It can take in Objects and functions</li>
        <li>Its values are seperated with a comma(,)</li>
      </ul>
      <code>
        let fruits = ['Apple', 'Banana']<br>

        console.log(fruits.length)<br>
        // 2<br>
      </code>

     <section class = 'main-section' id = 'objects'>
      <header>Objects</header>
      <p>
        A JavaScript object has properties associated with it. A property of an object can be 
        explained as a variable that is attached to the object. Object properties are basically 
        the same as ordinary JavaScript variables, except for the attachment to objects
      </p>
      <p>
        Like all JavaScript variables, both the object name (which could be a normal variable) and 
        property name are case sensitive. You can define a property by assigning it a value. For 
        example, let's create an object named myCar and give it properties named make, model, and 
        year as follows:
      </p>
      <code>
        // four variables are created and assigned in a single go, 
        // separated by commas<br>
        var myObj = new Object(),<br>
            str = 'myString',<br>
            rand = Math.random(),<br>
            obj = new Object();<br>

        myObj.type              = 'Dot syntax';<br>
        myObj['date created']   = 'String with space';<br>
        myObj[str]              = 'String value';<br>
        myObj[rand]             = 'Random Number';<br>
        myObj[obj]              = 'Object';<br>
        myObj['']               = 'Even an empty string';<br>

        console.log(myObj);<br>
      </code>
